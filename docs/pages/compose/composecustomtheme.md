## :material-code-tags: Setup Library

```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {

        // register all available themes or register your custom themes
        ComposeTheme.register(
            *ComposeThemes
                .getAllThemes()
                .toTypedArray()
        )
    }

}
```

## :keyboard: Usage

```kotlin
// simply wrap your composable content inside ComposeTheme as if you would use MaterialTheme directly
val baseTheme = remember { mutableStateOf(ComposeTheme.BaseTheme.System) }
val dynamic = remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
val theme = remember { mutableStateOf("green") } // the key of an registered theme
val state = ComposeTheme.State(baseTheme, dynamic, theme)
ComposeTheme(state = state) {
    // content
}
```

## :material-view-module: Modules and Extensions

There only exists on very small extension for this library.

??? info-primary "Extension Themes"

    This extension adds a collection of default themes that you can use if needed.

    ```kotlin
    // returns a list of all existing default themes
    val themes = ComposeThemes.list()

    // or get the default themes one by one
    val theme = ThemeAmberBlue.get()
    // ... there are 56 predefined themes availabe ...
    ```

## :material-professional-hexagon: Advanced Usage

??? info-primary "Custom Statusbar / Navigationbar Colors"

    The default themes do use functions that allow you to define some custom statusbar / navigation settings if desired. Supported colors are `default`, `primary` and `surface` (those colors derive their color from the theme itself) or `custom` for fully user defined colors.

    ```kotlin
    // get all themes with custom statusbar / navigation bar
    ComposeThemes.list(
        statusBarColor = ComposeTheme.SystemUIColor.Surface,
        navigationBarColor = ComposeTheme.SystemUIColor.Surface
    )

    // or get a single predefined theme with custom statusbar / navigation bar
    val theme = ThemeAmberBlue.get(
        statusBarColor = ComposeTheme.SystemUIColor.Surface,
        navigationBarColor = ComposeTheme.SystemUIColor.Surface
    )
    ```

## :material-handshake: Credits

This library contains 54 predefined color schemes inside the `themes` module. Those are all directly copied from [FlexColorScheme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-latest/) - a very useful homepage that allows you to **create your own themes** and also contains 54 predefined themes already. With the permission of [Rydmike](https://github.com/rydmike) I just copied every single predefined theme from his homepage and added it to this library.
